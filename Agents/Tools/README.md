# Agents/Tools — campaign tooling

Apparatus for the stabilization campaign. **Not application code and not part of any
build.** Nothing in `src/` imports from here.

## `save-gen/` — synthetic save-data generator and snapshot benchmarks

Generates deterministic RisuAI save data at four sizes and measures the cost of
`$state.snapshot()` over it. Built for Phase 2 (RAM / rendering performance).

- **Seed 1337.** Fixtures are reproducible; a run today matches a run from the session
  that first produced these numbers.
- **Tiers:** `light`, `chat-heavy`, `module-heavy`, `both-heavy`.
- Reuses the repo's real `encodeRisuSaveLegacy` / `decodeRisuSave` via the same
  `vi.mock` pattern as `src/ts/storage/tests/risuSave.test.ts`, so generated `.bin`
  files are real save files rather than approximations.

### Running it

```
npx vitest run --config Agents/Tools/vitest.harness.config.ts
```

Runs from the repo root. The config derives the repo root from its own location, so
there are no absolute paths to update if the repo moves.

### The `.harness.ts` suffix is load-bearing — do not rename

The repo's `vitest.config.ts` declares **no `include`**, so `pnpm test` falls back to
vitest's default glob `**/*.{test,spec}.?(c|m)[jt]s?(x)`. These files were
`*.spec.ts` while they lived outside the repo, where that did not matter. Inside the
repo it does: under the old names `pnpm test` would discover and run them, breaking a
verified baseline of **31 files / 331 passed / 3 skipped** and adding minutes of
benchmark time to every suite run.

`*.harness.ts` does not match that glob. **Do not rename these back to `*.spec.ts`,
and do not add `*.test.ts` / `*.spec.ts` files in this directory.** If you ever need
that, add an explicit `exclude` to the repo's `vitest.config.ts` first and verify the
baseline afterwards.

Baselines were re-confirmed after this directory was added: `pnpm test` 31 files /
331 passed / 3 skipped, `pnpm check` 0 errors / 0 warnings.

### Generated output

`generate-and-verify.harness.ts` writes real fixture `.bin` files to
`Agents/Tools/output/` (~12 MB for a full run). That directory is gitignored. It is
safe to delete at any time; a rerun regenerates it identically from seed 1337.

### Known flake

The `both-heavy` snapshot benchmark can exceed vitest's default 5000 ms per-test
timeout on a loaded machine — it does real `$state.snapshot()` work over ~10 MB of
proxied data. Observed once under the verbose reporter, passing on clean runs before
and after. It is a timing flake, not a defect. Rerun, or raise the timeout for that
case if it becomes persistent.

### Harnesses that mock the app's rune modules: keep them in ONE file

Learned while building `save-gen/trash-restore-repro.svelte.harness.ts` (2026-09-21). The
`<name>.harness.ts` + `<name>.svelte.ts` split used by the benches works when the rune module only
defines test-local state. It **breaks** when the `vi.mock(...)` factory for an app module is split
across files via a dynamic `import()`: the real, unmocked `src/ts/stores.svelte.ts` and
`src/ts/parser/parser.svelte.ts` then load and fire their own top-level `$effect.root` blocks against
the thin mocks, producing unhandled exceptions. A single self-contained file avoids it.

Name such a file `<name>.svelte.harness.ts`. It still ends in `.harness.ts`, so `pnpm test`'s
default glob never matches it, and it carries the `.svelte.` infix that vite-plugin-svelte needs to
compile runes — the same mechanism that lets `src/ts/storage/tests/dbChangeEffects.svelte.test.ts`
use `$state`.

Also note these harnesses measure on whatever machine runs them. Campaign measurements to date were
taken on an i9-13900K; see the Stage B plan (`Agents/Reports/11-...`, section 1.1) before quoting
any absolute millisecond figure as a user-facing claim.

## Reference measurements (2026-09-21, this machine)

Module-heavy tier, 52 modules / 7.27 MB, 3 warmup discarded + 15 measured, three
independent process runs, medians reported with floor alongside:

| Condition | Per `$state.snapshot(modules)` | Floor | Per keystroke (2 calls) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dev (`DEV === true`) | 34.46 ms | 33.04 ms | 68.92 ms |
| Production (`DEV === false`) | 29.15 ms | 28.65 ms | 58.29 ms |

Frame budget is 16.7 ms. Production was forced by resolving `esm-env` to its
`production` condition and **verified behaviourally** — `snapshot()` only calls
`state_snapshot_uncloneable()` inside the `DEV` branch, so a `console.warn` spy on a
deliberately uncloneable value fired under dev and not under production.

Dev overstates by **1.18x**, not by a multiple. A hypothesis that DEV instrumentation
inflated the headline figure was tested and **disproven**; do not revive it.

**Caveat carried from the measuring session:** these run against a standalone
`$state({db:...})` container, not the real `DBState` wired into the effect graph. They
are raw snapshot cost only and exclude the effects' downstream work.

**CORRECTION (2026-09-21):** this caveat originally said the real per-keystroke figure is
"this **or higher**, never lower". Measured in the live app, that is **wrong on engine speed**:
Chromium ran the same seed-1337 fixture **~2.6x faster** than this Node harness (whole-array
snapshot 11.3 ms in-browser vs 29.8 ms here), while the downstream effect work it warns about
turned out to be only ~0.2 ms. The **ratios** between conditions held (~8x whole-array vs
single-module on both), so these harnesses remain valid for comparing designs — just not for
absolute frame-budget claims. Full measurement: `Agents/Reports/10-...`, section 10.5f.

## Stage A after-measurement (2026-09-21, same machine)

`track-module-deps-bench.harness.ts` measures `trackModuleUpdateDeps()`
(`src/ts/process/moduleUpdateDeps.ts`) against `$state.snapshot(modules)` over the same
seed-1337 module-heavy fixture, in the same process, so the two sides are comparable.
Both sides are measured fresh on each run rather than compared against a number in this
file. Production is forced with `NODE_ENV=production` in front of the command — a
`resolve.conditions` override does **not** work, because Vite injects its own
`development`/`production` condition ahead of custom ones based on `NODE_ENV`.

```
NODE_ENV=production npx vitest run --config Agents/Tools/vitest.harness.config.ts Agents/Tools/save-gen/track-module-deps-bench.harness.ts --reporter=verbose
```

| Condition | `$state.snapshot(modules)` | `trackModuleUpdateDeps()` | Per keystroke before | Per keystroke after |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dev | 33.87 ms | 0.045 ms | 67.74 ms | 33.92 ms |
| Production | 29.18 ms | 0.031 ms | 58.35 ms | 29.21 ms |

**Read the per-keystroke columns carefully.** Stage A replaced **one** of the two
per-keystroke snapshot calls. The other, `dbChangeEffects.svelte.ts:34`, is deliberately
untouched because it gates whether modules are re-encoded to disk. So "after" is
`snapshot + trackModuleUpdateDeps`, not `trackModuleUpdateDeps` alone.

**The frame budget is still missed.** 29.2 ms production is 175% of 16.7 ms, and 33.9 ms
dev is 203%. The surviving `dbChangeEffects` snapshot exceeds the whole budget on its
own. The 2.00x and the ~29 ms saved per keystroke are real; the frame-budget problem is
not solved and Stage A never claimed it would be.

Two deviations from the older measurements above, both deliberate:
- The fixture is enriched with `namespace` / `hideIcon` / `backgroundEmbedding`, which
  `build.ts` leaves unset, so the narrowed read is not timed against absent properties.
  Same shape, size and module count; the freshly measured production snapshot median
  landed within 0.1% of the 29.15 ms published above, which is the cross-check.
- `trackModuleUpdateDeps()` is batched 500 calls per sample and divided out. At ~0.03 ms
  a single call is close enough to timer resolution that an unbatched number would not be
  defensible.

Same standalone-container caveat as above: raw call cost, real figure is this or higher.

## Stage B after-measurement (2026-09-21) — the per-keystroke cost, resolved

Stage A left the frame-budget problem unsolved, as the section above says. **Stage B solved it**, by
partitioning the surviving `dbChangeEffects.svelte.ts` modules effect into an outer effect over
array shape plus one child effect per module — preserving the dependency closure exactly, not
narrowing it. Plan and gate records: `Agents/Reports/11-stage-b-module-effect-partition-plan.md`.

Measured in the **live app**, not this harness: module editor open, real `input` events, timed to
forced layout, identical protocol before and after, i9-13900K, dev build.

| Modules | Before | After | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| 52 | 13.2 ms | 1.9 ms | 6.9x |
| 104 | 25.1 ms | 1.8 ms | 13.9x |
| scaling 52 -> 104 | 1.9x (O(modules)) | **0.95x (flat)** | — |

The flat scaling is the point: cost no longer depends on module count. The ratio and the flatness
are hardware-independent; the absolute figures are high-end-desktop numbers and are **not** a
frame-budget claim for Raspberry Pi or mobile.

Benches added for the Stage B decision, all `.harness.ts`:
- `module-partition-bench` — whole-array vs single-module vs per-element-sum snapshot cost.
- `module-scaling-bench` (+ `module-scaling-fixture.ts`) — asset-heavy module shapes and 52-vs-104
  scaling. **Key result: snapshot cost tracks node count, not bytes** — a 1.03 MB asset-shaped
  module costs ~8x a 1.65 MB cjs-heavy one. The 104 point duplicates the 52-module fixture.
- `module-effect-overhead-bench` — `$effect` scheduling/teardown overhead of N children vs 1
  (below measurement noise). Note: it creates children directly in `$effect.root`, not inside a
  *re-running* parent effect; the real nested path is covered by the app test suite instead.
- `trash-restore-repro.svelte.harness.ts` — **not a benchmark**: an end-to-end reproduction of
  the restore-from-trash data-loss bug (Roadmap CHORE-01 / CHORE-03).

## Measuring in the live app (browser pane) — protocol and traps

The harnesses above run in Node. The Stage B before/after numbers came from the **live app**, which
is the measurement that should back any user-facing latency claim. What worked, and three traps that
each produced a plausible-looking wrong number first:

**Setup.** `.claude/launch.json` defines `risuai-web` on port 5174, but the app needs
`VITE_RISU_LEGAL_CONFIGURED=TRUE`, which `launch.json` does not set. Pass it **inline for the one
run** (`VITE_RISU_LEGAL_CONFIGURED=TRUE pnpm dev`). Do **not** bake it into `launch.json` or a
`.env`: `src/lib/Others/Legal.svelte:6-8` says in capitals not to set it automatically. If a ToS
dialog appears, the **user** accepts it; never click it. The Claude browser pane has its own
storage, which held the seed-1337 **fixture** (52 modules, names like `Module 2 (giant)`) — not
the maintainer's personal data. Check which you are looking at before mutating anything.

**Getting the app's own state.** `await import('/src/ts/stores.svelte.ts')` from the page returns
the live `DBState` and stores. Drive the UI through those stores rather than hunting icons:
`settingsOpen.set(true); SettingsMenuIndex.set(14)` opens Settings -> Modules.

**Trap 1 — after editing a source file, a bare import gives you an EMPTY copy.** Vite then serves
changed modules with a `?t=` cache-busting query, so `import('/src/ts/stores.svelte.ts')` no longer
matches the app's instance and yields a **separate module with its own empty `DBState`**. Symptom:
`Object.keys(DBState.db).length === 0` while the console shows the save decoded fine. Fix: restart
the dev server, then reload.

**Trap 2 — importing `svelte` from the page loads a SECOND runtime.** Its `flushSync` drives a
different scheduler from the app's, and a timed mutation measured **0 ms**. Do not use it. Drain
microtasks instead: Svelte flushes on `queueMicrotask`, so awaiting three nested microtasks after a
mutation is enough.

**Trap 3 — `requestAnimationFrame` never fires while the pane is hidden.** A script awaiting rAF
hangs until the tool times out, possibly **mid-mutation, leaving data dirty**. Time to a forced
synchronous layout instead: drain microtasks, then read `document.documentElement.offsetHeight`.
That captures effect + DOM + layout; it excludes paint, which is small and off the main thread.

**Protocol used for Stage B.** Open the module editor on the largest module, dispatch **real**
`input` events into the name field (native value setter + `new Event('input', {bubbles:true})`),
3 warm-up + 8-10 measured iterations, median/min/max, to forced layout. For module-count scaling,
push deep-copied duplicates with fresh ids (`JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(m))`, new `id`, `DUP ` name
prefix), measure, then `splice` them back off.

**Always restore, and verify you did.** Wrap every mutation in `try/finally` that restores the
original value, then check: module count unchanged, no `DUP ` entries, no stray suffixes on names,
settings UI closed. Trap 3 left a real `Module 2 (giant)w` behind once; it was only caught because
restoration was checked, not assumed.

**Report the hardware.** These figures came from an i9-13900K and are a lower bound on latency.
