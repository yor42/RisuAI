/**
 * Empirical reproduction for the claim: "Restore a character from trash,
 * don't open it, close the app -- it comes back on next load."
 *
 * ALLEGED MECHANISM (verified against source before this harness was
 * written -- all three references below were read and confirmed to say
 * exactly what the claim says, not assumed):
 *
 *   1. src/ts/storage/dbChangeEffects.svelte.ts's effect 6 (the generic
 *      per-key loop, :93-122) deep-reads ONLY
 *      DBState.db.characters[selIdState] -- the SELECTED character -- and
 *      excludes 'characters' from its own generic per-key loop (:96-98).
 *      opts.tracker.character is written only inside the
 *      `if (DBState?.db?.characters?.[selIdState])` branch (:110-112),
 *      gated on that same selected index.
 *
 *   2. src/lib/Others/GridCatalog.svelte:141-147 restores a trashed
 *      character by index-by-id, NOT by selection:
 *
 *          const restoreIdx = findCharacterIndexbyId(char.chaId)
 *          if (restoreIdx !== -1) {
 *              DBState.db.characters[restoreIdx].trashTime = undefined
 *              checkCharOrder()
 *          }
 *
 *      checkCharOrder() (src/ts/globalApi.svelte.ts:1664+) mutates only
 *      DBState.db.characterOrder (pushes the now-untrashed chaId if it is
 *      not already present).
 *
 *   3. db.characterOrder IS one of the generic keys deep-read by effect 6's
 *      per-key loop, so a save cycle fires (tracker gets marked dirty). But
 *      the restored character's chaId was never selected, so it never
 *      enters opts.tracker.character. src/ts/storage/risuSave.ts's
 *      RisuSaveEncoder.set() (:284-308) then hits, for that character,
 *      `else if(!this.blocks[character.chaId])` at :298 -- a block already
 *      exists from init() -- so the STALE cached block (still carrying
 *      trashTime) is reused verbatim rather than being re-encoded from the
 *      live (restored) object.
 *
 * This harness drives the REAL registerDbChangeEffects() and the REAL
 * RisuSaveEncoder end to end -- not reimplementations -- to see whether
 * that chain actually produces a stale on-disk trashTime, or whether some
 * untraced mechanism (e.g. a different effect also covering `characters`,
 * or set()'s directory rebuild) saves the day. Source-tracing has been
 * wrong before in this campaign; this is the empirical check.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IS NAMED `*.svelte.harness.ts`, not plain `*.harness.ts`
 * with a `.svelte.ts` sibling (the pattern the other benches in this
 * directory use): this reproduction needs `$state`/`$state.snapshot`
 * (to build the reactive DBState mock and to snapshot it for the encoder)
 * AND a `vi.mock(import('.../stores.svelte'), factory)` whose factory must
 * itself construct that `$state` object. Runes only compile inside files
 * matched by vite-plugin-svelte's `.svelte.` module-infix rule (see
 * node_modules/@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte/src/utils/id.js's
 * `buildModuleIdFilter` -- any filename containing the literal substring
 * `.svelte.` before a recognized extension, which is also why
 * src/ts/storage/tests/dbChangeEffects.svelte.test.ts can use `$state`
 * directly despite also being a `.test.ts` file). Splitting the mock
 * factory and the rune-touching helpers into a separate `.svelte.ts`
 * sibling (as module-effect-overhead-bench.harness.ts does) was tried
 * first and produced two unhandled exceptions from REAL, unmocked
 * src/ts/stores.svelte.ts and src/ts/parser/parser.svelte.ts -- both also
 * `.svelte.` infix files -- executing their own top-level `$effect.root`
 * blocks against the deliberately-thin mocks in this file. A same-file,
 * self-contained diagnostic proved this was specifically caused by
 * splitting the `vi.mock` factory across files (with a dynamic
 * `import()` inside it to reach the rune-touching helper), not by
 * anything about the `stores.svelte` mock's content, this file's other
 * mocks, or the risuSave.ts import graph -- all of which were tested
 * independently and ruled out. Keeping the factory and every rune call in
 * this one `.svelte.harness.ts` file (still ending in `.harness.ts`, so
 * `pnpm test`'s default discovery glob still never matches it -- see
 * Agents/Tools/README.md) reproduces cleanly with zero unhandled errors.
 *
 * Run:
 *   npx vitest run --config Agents/Tools/vitest.harness.config.ts Agents/Tools/save-gen/trash-restore-repro.svelte.harness.ts --reporter=verbose
 *
 * Read-only w.r.t. src/ -- this file drives the real modules, it does not
 * modify them.
