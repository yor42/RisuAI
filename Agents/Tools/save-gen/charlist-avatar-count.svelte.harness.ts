/**
 * PREMISE MEASUREMENT (not a bug repro, not a fix) for a planned performance
 * change to the character-list page.
 *
 * HYPOTHESIS UNDER TEST (source-read by the Orchestrator, measured here, not
 * assumed): `src/lib/Others/GridCatalog.svelte` renders four layouts
 * (3 = simple, delegating to `src/lib/Mobile/MobileCharacters.svelte`;
 * 0 = grid; 1 = list; 2 = trash), each iterating an UNKEYED `{#each
 * formatChars(search, DBState.db) as char}` (or `sortChar(...)` for simple).
 * `formatChars` (`GridCatalog.svelte:23-53`) builds brand-new objects on
 * every call, and every item passes `additionalStyle={getCharImage(char.image,
 * 'css')}` straight into `BarIcon.svelte`, which `{#await}`s it
 * (`BarIcon.svelte:13-17`). `getCharImage` (`src/ts/characters.ts:54-86`)
 * always calls `getFileSrc(loc)` (`src/ts/globalApi.svelte.ts:170-291`) when
 * a location is present. On the plain-HTTP branch (no Tauri, no service
 * worker, no account), `getFileSrc` re-encodes the whole asset to a base64
 * `data:` URL on EVERY call, including cache hits (`globalApi.svelte.ts:285`
 * runs unconditionally after either branch of the `if(!existing)` check).
 * The hypothesis: every listed character is mounted on initial render, and
 * every re-render (a search keystroke, or ANY mutation of a field
 * `formatChars` reads -- name, image, trashTime, type, creatorNotes -- on
 * ANY character, whether or not that character is currently visible in the
 * active layout) re-invokes `getCharImage`/`getFileSrc` for EVERY listed
 * character, not just a changed one.
 *
 * UPDATE (post-AV-1, `Agents/Reports/12-charlist-avatar-plan.md` section 2):
 * the hypothesis above described the code as it stood BEFORE this plan
 * landed. `GridCatalog.svelte` and `MobileCharacters.svelte` now read each
 * item's image through a two-level `{@const imgPath = char.image}` /
 * `{@const avatarStyle = getCharImage(imgPath, 'css')}` derived boundary
 * (plan section 2.2(i)), which only re-invokes `getCharImage`/`getFileSrc`
 * when the resolved path string itself changes, and grid/list/trash are now
 * keyed by `char.index` (plan section 2.2(ii)) so filtering/reordering no
 * longer changes which key maps to which image. The action-count
 * assertions below (`ACTIONS` / the per-N `expect` block) are pinned
 * against THIS fixed code, with the old, pre-fix numbers kept alongside
 * them as history; the paragraph above is left as originally written
 * because it is still the accurate rationale for why this harness measures
 * what it measures, not because it describes current behaviour.
 *
 * WHAT THIS HARNESS DOES: mounts the REAL `GridCatalog.svelte` (and
 * therefore the real `MobileCharacters.svelte` and `BarIcon.svelte`) with
 * Svelte's `mount()` into happy-dom, drives it exactly like a user would
 * (click the real layout buttons, type into the real search input, mutate
 * `DBState.db` directly the way the rest of the app does), and counts calls
 * to a spy standing in for `getFileSrc` -- the ONE thing mocked on the hot
 * path, per the task brief. `getCharImage` itself is REAL: this file does
 * NOT mock `src/ts/characters.ts`, so the exact call path the app takes
 * (template -> BarIcon prop -> getCharImage -> getFileSrc) is exercised
 * verbatim.
 *
 * WHY GETCHARIMAGE COULD BE KEPT REAL DESPITE THE HEAVY IMPORT GRAPH:
 * `characters.ts` transitively imports most of the app's processing engine
 * (`process/index.svelte.ts` -- memory systems, transformers, TTS,
 * multiuser sync; `parser/parser.svelte.ts` -- markdown/highlight/regex;
 * `characterCards.ts` -- card import/export; `process/coldstorage.svelte.ts`;
 * `translator/translator.ts`). A throwaway probe (deleted before this file
 * was finalized -- see git history/PR description, not present in this
 * repo) confirmed empirically that importing this ENTIRE graph in this
 * harness's happy-dom + vi.mock setup is NOT a hang: it completes in a
 * bounded, reproducible ~15-17s on this machine (Vite/esbuild
 * transforming ~100+ modules cold, once per process), then every
 * subsequent import/mount in the same process is fast (tens of ms). That
 * is a one-time transform cost, not a per-test cost, so the first test
 * below carries a generous timeout and the rest do not need it. Nothing
 * in that graph is mocked beyond what the two existing rune-module
 * harnesses in this directory already establish as necessary
 * (`localforage`, `src/ts/globalApi.svelte`, `src/ts/storage/database.svelte`,
 * `src/ts/platform`, `@tauri-apps/plugin-fs`, `src/ts/stores.svelte`) --
 * none of the heavier modules (`alert`, `sionyw`, `parser.svelte`,
 * `characterCards`, `process/index.svelte`) needed mocking here, unlike in
 * `cold-storage-orphan-repro.svelte.harness.ts`, because nothing in these
 * scenarios calls into their exported functions; only characters.ts's own
 * synchronous top-level module body runs, and the probe confirmed that
 * body -- and everything it drags in -- tolerates the same thin,
 * genuinely-reactive `stores.svelte` mock used elsewhere in this directory
 * without throwing.
 *
 * MOCKED, AND WHY:
 *   - `localforage` -- IndexedDB backend; not exercised by anything the
 *     mounted components call in these scenarios, stubbed to be inert.
 *   - `src/ts/globalApi.svelte` -- this is where `getFileSrc` lives; it is
 *     replaced with a COUNTING SPY that logs every call and its argument,
 *     returns a distinct string per `loc`, and resolves on the same
 *     microtask tick (no artificial delay) so re-renders settle fast. Every
 *     other named export characters.ts/util.ts/characterCards.ts/etc. pull
 *     from this module is stubbed with an inert no-op; the probe confirmed
 *     none of them are touched at module-evaluation time, and none of these
 *     scenarios call the character-mutation helpers (`changeChar`,
 *     `removeChar`, import/export) that would need them for real.
 *   - `src/ts/storage/database.svelte` -- `getDatabase()` throws if called;
 *     never called, `DBState.db` is set directly instead (same pattern as
 *     both existing `.svelte.harness.ts` files in this directory).
 *   - `src/ts/platform` -- forces the plain-HTTP branch (`isTauri: false`),
 *     which is the branch under measurement.
 *   - `@tauri-apps/plugin-fs` -- present in `node_modules` and importable
 *     for real, but stubbed anyway (matches the other harnesses; not
 *     exercised when `isTauri` is false).
 *   - `src/ts/stores.svelte` -- replaced with a thin, genuinely reactive
 *     (`$state`-backed) stand-in exposing every store this import graph
 *     reads (`DBState`, `selectedCharID`, `MobileGUIStack`, `CharEmotion`,
 *     `OpenRealmStore`, `MobileSearch`, `alertStore`, `selIdState`,
 *     `SettingsMenuIndex`, `ShowRealmFrameStore`, `settingsOpen`). Kept in
 *     THIS ONE FILE per Agents/Tools/README.md's "Harnesses that mock the
 *     app's rune modules: keep them in ONE file" -- splitting the factory
 *     across files reproduces the unhandled-exception trap documented
 *     there for `trash-restore-repro.svelte.harness.ts`.
 *
 * NOT mocked: `src/ts/characters.ts` (`getCharImage` is real), `src/lang`,
 * `src/ts/util.ts` (`findCharacterIndexbyId`, `parseMultilangString`),
 * `GridCatalog.svelte`, `MobileCharacters.svelte`, `BarIcon.svelte`,
 * `TextInput.svelte`, `Button.svelte`, the lucide icon components, and
 * everything characters.ts drags in transitively.
 *
 * DRIVING THE UI: layout buttons are located by matching a real button's
 * `textContent` against the real `language.grid` / `.list` / `.trash` /
 * `.simple` strings and `.click()`ed (real click, not internal state
 * poking). The search box is the first `<input type="text">` under the
 * mounted root; its value is set via the native `HTMLInputElement.value`
 * setter (bypassing Svelte's own binding) and a real `input` event is
 * dispatched, exactly as the task requires.
 *
 * SETTLING: after every action, this harness calls the SAME `flushSync`
 * this component tree runs on (imported directly from `svelte`, the one
 * instance vite-plugin-svelte wires the compiled components to -- avoiding
 * the "importing `svelte` from the page loads a second runtime" trap noted
 * in the README, which does not apply here since this file IS the runtime
 * the components compile against), then repeatedly awaits a pair of
 * microtask ticks and re-checks both the getFileSrc call count and the
 * number of DOM nodes carrying a resolved avatar background, stopping once
 * both stop changing (bounded at 50 iterations as a safety cap, never hit
 * in practice since the mock `getFileSrc` resolves in one tick and nothing
 * here chains promises).
 *
 * WHAT "INITIAL MOUNT OF THAT LAYOUT" MEANS FOR NON-DEFAULT LAYOUTS:
 * `GridCatalog`'s own `selected` state always defaults to 3 (simple), so a
 * fresh `mount()` always renders simple first. For layouts 0/1/2, this
 * harness mounts fresh, lets the DEFAULT simple layout settle (uncounted),
 * clears the spy, THEN clicks that layout's button and measures from there
 * -- i.e. "initial mount of layout N" measures the cost of that layout's
 * each-block rendering for the very first time, isolated from the default
 * layout's own mount cost. This is the only sense in which "initial mount"
 * is meaningful for a layout that is never the component's own default.
 *
 * Run:
 *   npx vitest run --config Agents/Tools/vitest.harness.config.ts Agents/Tools/save-gen/charlist-avatar-count.svelte.harness.ts --reporter=verbose
 *
 * Read-only w.r.t. src/ -- this file drives the real modules, it does not
 * modify them.

//#region AV-2 IntersectionObserver fake (see comment below)

/**
 * AV-2 (`Agents/Reports/14-av2-lazy-avatar-plan.md`, section 3.1) now gates
 * each avatar's resolution on `nearViewport`'s use of `IntersectionObserver`,
 * and happy-dom's own `IntersectionObserver` never invokes its callback at
 * all (`observe()` is a no-op there), so without a fake every avatar here
 * would stay permanently unresolved and every measurement below would read 0
 * lookups no matter what actually changed. Per the plan's v8 ("AV-1's tests
 * must still pass with the fake reporting all visible"), this fake reports
 * every observed target immediately, permanently visible -- the same
 * "everything resolves" behaviour this harness measured before AV-2 existed
 * -- so it keeps measuring AV-1's per-change re-lookup behaviour, not AV-2's
 * visibility gating.
 *
 * SYNCHRONOUS, ON PURPOSE: `nearViewport.svelte.ts` (`use:nearViewport`'s
 * setup) reads nothing about *when* its `IntersectionObserver` callback
 * fires -- it only registers a per-target callback and calls `observe()`;
 * there is no code path anywhere in it, or in this file's `settle()` helper,
 * that depends on the callback arriving asynchronously. An EARLIER version
 * of this fake deferred its callback via `queueMicrotask`, matching the real
 * spec's always-async delivery -- but that extra hop raced `settle()`'s own
 * "stop once two consecutive checks agree" convergence loop: `settle()`
 * could observe two stable-looking ticks and return BEFORE the deferred
 * microtask had even run, letting that call land after the NEXT action's
 * own `getFileSrcSpy.mockClear()`, misattributing it (confirmed empirically
 * against this same fake in the sibling test file: the suite was measurably
 * flaky with the deferred version, and merely adding unrelated
 * `console.log` calls -- extra synchronous work shifting microtask timing
 * -- was enough to flip failures to passes on an unchanged assertion).
 * Firing synchronously inside `observe()` removes that hop entirely:
 * `onChange(true)` runs in the same tick as the mount/update that called
 * `observe()`, exactly like AV-1's pre-AV-2 behaviour (avatars started
 * resolving synchronously at render time, no observer indirection at all),
 * which is precisely the behaviour this harness measures. Installed before
 * any component ever mounts (module-level, not inside a hook), per
 * `nearViewport.svelte.ts`'s own test-seam doc comment.

/**
 * ONE fresh mount per layout, reused for the initial-mount measurement AND
 * all five action measurements in sequence (rather than a fresh mount per
 * action). This is a deliberate departure from the "isolate everything"
 * instinct: mounting a reactive N=1000 character tree 6x per layout (72
 * mounts total across all three N tiers) reliably drove this harness's
 * Node process out of heap (`Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit`)
 * on this machine before this change -- happy-dom + Svelte 5's per-property
 * reactive proxies are not cheap per character, and repeated large mounts
 * within one process outpaced GC. Reusing one mount per layout cuts total
 * mounts to 12 (4 layouts x 3 N tiers) and completes without OOM. Isolation
 * between actions is preserved by explicitly resetting the search box to
 * '' (settled, uncounted) before every action, so each measured action
 * always starts from the same "full list visible" baseline regardless of
 * what the previous action did.
