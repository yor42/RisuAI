              Fifth grid child, last in DOM order: on mobile every link card
              stacks above it, so the realm preview can no longer push
              Related Links below the fold; on desktop it sits beside and
              below the link cards.

              lg:col-span-1 is load-bearing, not redundant: both the md: and
              lg: breakpoints are live at >=1024px, and md:col-span-2 emits
              the `grid-column` shorthand (sets both start and end) while
              lg:col-start-3 is a longhand that only overrides the start.
              Without an lg: span reset, the end stays `span 2` and the card
              spills into a fabricated fourth column track. Verified by
              compiling this exact class list through the repo's own
              tailwindcss build rather than assumed.

              This div is deliberately not a <button>: realmDirectOpen is a
              persisted setting whose help text promises that clicking a
              character in the preview opens that character, and this file
              is the only reader of it. A single wrapping <button> would
              silently disable that setting (interactive children inside a
              button are invalid) while the setting kept appearing in
              Advanced Settings, so the preview rows and the offline/failed
              Retry controls below stay their own buttons.

              The card itself is still the browse target: a click anywhere
              on it that isn't the scrollable entries list, or one of the
              Retry controls (which
              stop their own click's propagation to keep their own
              meaning), opens RisuRealm — see handleCardClick above — and
              the hover lift, brighter-on-hover background and decorative
              icon mirror the other Related Links cards' treatment so the
              whole card reads as clickable. A click handler on a div is
              mouse-only, so the title below is its own focusable button
              carrying the browse label, keeping a keyboard path into the
              same action.

              The ceiling belongs on the scrollable list, not the card: capping
              the list at a fixed height keeps the card's own intrinsic height
              (padding + header + description + that constant list height)
              the same whether hubStatus is pending or populated, which is
              what actually stops MC-053's layout shift on fetch resolution.
              The card itself carries no unqualified max-height, so it stays
              an ordinary grid item and stretches to fill its grid area
              instead of falling short of it. min-h-0 on the list is still
              required: without it the flex item refuses to shrink below its
              own content and overflow-y-auto never engages.

              lg:min-h-[380px] is not cosmetic. The list's cap grows to
              lg:max-h-[200px] below (see that comment), and the card's
              required height must stay under whatever height is actually
              available at each breakpoint or the fetch-time shift comes
              back — a bigger cap needs a bigger floor to still fit inside.
              At lg the grid area is driven by the neighbouring link cards'
              wrapped descriptions and comfortably clears 380px in current
              measurements; below lg the card is a full-width single-row
              item sitting at the plain 296px floor, so it keeps the smaller
              cap instead of forcing a tall solid block onto tablet widths.

                  the inner scroller is what holds the card's intrinsic
                  height constant across hubStatus states — the panel is
                  purely a background, not a layout change.
                  data-realm-preview-list stays on the outer panel so
                  handleCardClick's delegated closest() check bails on
                  clicks anywhere in the panel's padding too, not just on
                  the rows themselves.

                  max-h-[150px] lg:max-h-[200px]: a single cap across every
                  width does not work. The cap and the card's lg:min-h-[380px]
                  above move together — the cap must stay small enough that
                  the card's required height (padding + header + description
                  + this cap) never exceeds the height actually available at
                  that breakpoint, or the card grows past its floor and
                  MC-053's fetch-time shift comes straight back. 150 clears
                  the smaller-breakpoint floor of 296; 200 needs the taller
                  380 floor at lg to still clear the available grid area.
                  Raising either number without raising its partner
                  reintroduces the shift — verify both again with real
                  measurements before changing either.

          Gated on realmHidden, not just a non-empty string: this banner is
          realm-server content too, so hideRealm hides the whole realm
          widget, announcement included, rather than leaving server-supplied
          HTML on screen after the user opts out.

          This wrapper and the heading below it are new decoration around
          the sanitized sink, not a change to it: the content is HTML from
          upstream's realm server, rendered unlabelled it could be misread
          as a first-party message, so the heading names the source. The
          container borrows the link cards' shape (rounded-2xl, border,
          bg-darkbg, padding) so it reads as a deliberate element, but
          carries no hover lift and is not itself clickable — only the
          links the sanitizer allows inside it are, through the existing
          delegated handler.
