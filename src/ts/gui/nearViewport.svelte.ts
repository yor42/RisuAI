/**
 * AV-2: a shared
 * Svelte action that reports whether an element is near enough to its
 * scrolling ancestor to resolve its avatar, and far enough away to release
 * it again.
 *
 * `use:nearViewport={{ onChange }}` calls `onChange(true)` once the element
 * comes within one root-height of its scroll root (the "near" band,
 * `rootMargin: '100% 0px'`), and `onChange(false)` once it leaves a wider,
 * three-root-height band (the "far" band, `rootMargin: '300% 0px'`). The gap
 * between the two bands is deliberate hysteresis: an item becomes visible
 * only via the near band, and becomes invisible only via the far band, so it
 * never thrashes right at one edge.
 *
 * Root selection: the nearest ancestor whose COMPUTED `overflow-y` is `auto`
 * or `scroll`, else `null` (the real viewport). This is always a real
 * ancestor of the target, so the observer can never be handed a box that
 * isn't one -- per spec that would simply never report an intersection, and
 * avatars would never load. If the chosen box doesn't actually scroll, every
 * item intersects it immediately and behaviour degrades to "everything
 * resolves", never to "nothing loads".
 *
 * Sharing: one IntersectionObserver per (root, rootMargin) pair, not one per
 * item, keyed by a registry documented on `rootRegistry` below.
 *
 * Test seam: the observer constructor is read from
 * `globalThis.IntersectionObserver` at use time (not imported), so tests can
 * `vi.stubGlobal` a controllable fake before any element ever calls this
 * action. If the global is missing entirely (very old WebViews), every
 * target is treated as immediately, permanently visible -- fail open,
 * today's behaviour.
