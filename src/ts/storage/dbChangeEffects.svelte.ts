    // `$state.snapshot()`'s plain-object branch clones via
    // `Object.keys(value)` then reads `value[key]` for each key
    // (svelte/src/internal/shared/clone.js:92-102). `Object.keys` goes
    // through the proxy's `ownKeys` trap, which reads the proxy's `version`
    // source before returning the key list (proxy.js:333-334: `ownKeys(target)
    // { get(version); ... }`). So the ORIGINAL single
    // `$state.snapshot(chats)` call already depended on the `version` source
    // of every chat object and every message object it reached, in addition
    // to every key and every value -- not merely "whatever the array/object
    // branches happen to walk". The array branch instead reads `.length` and
    // every index (clone.js:73-78), never the array's own `version`.
    //
    // The partition below reads exactly that same set, split across smaller
    // effects: `Object.keys(chat)` (+ a snapshot of every value except
    // `message`) reproduces a chat's version/keys/values dependency;
    // `chats.length` + `chats[i]` on the shape effect and its per-index
    // children reproduce the chats array's length/index dependency;
    // `message.length` + `message[j]` (array case) or
    // `$state.snapshot(message)` (malformed non-array case) reproduce the
    // message-level dependency the same way. Partition, never narrow (Report
    // 11 §4, §8 method).
    //
    // Duplicate ids: like the former merged effect, none of the pieces below
    // de-duplicate their front-unshift against ids the identity tracker (or
    // a `markCharacterForSave` mark) appends at the END of
    // `opts.tracker.character`. This is safe -- `savedId` in `risuSave.ts`'s
    // `set()` records which ids were saved this pass, and a character's block
    // is deleted only if its id was NOT saved this pass, so a duplicate or
    // stale id of an existing character is harmless; it is merely re-encoded,
    // not deleted.
    //
    // Every effect below (front, char outer, field children, chats-shape,
    // per-chat, per-message) independently does the SAME front-unshift of
    // the selected chaId, then calls `markChanged(ownRanOnce)` -- exactly
    // the modules-partition effect's convention above: children created
    // fresh always pass `false` on their first run, so a SHAPE change (a
    // chat pushed/spliced/replaced, a message array replaced, the character
    // itself replaced) is covered by the parent's own `markChanged(true)`,
    // never by a recreated child's first run.
    //
    // Decision on `chats[chatPage].id` (Report 17 Stage 2 instructions):
    // the pre-Stage-2 merged effect reads `characters[selIdState]?.chats[...chatPage].id`
    // WITHOUT `?.` on the `chats` element itself -- if `chats[chatPage]` is
    // undefined (an out-of-range or empty `chats`), `.id` throws. The
    // semantics are preserved below, even though the read was rewritten into
    // local variables: still no `?.` on that element, so it throws in the
    // same cases. This is a partition, not a bugfix, and adding `?.` would
    // silently change behaviour from "throws today" to "never throws" for a
    // case this plan does not analyze.
    //
    // chaId re-read at fronting time, not captured (Gate 3 REJECT item 2): only
    // 6b-front lists `chaId` itself as a tracked read (it needs the CURRENT
    // value to decide whether to front it and to build the `tracker.chat`
    // pair). Every other 6b piece (char outer, field/chats-shape/per-chat/
    // per-message children) must NOT add `chaId` to its own dependency list,
    // since their spec above does not list it -- EXCEPT the `chaId` field
    // child, which tracks it anyway through its own generic
    // `$state.snapshot(char[key])` read when `key === 'chaId'` (expected;
    // that snapshot dependency is what makes the field child re-run at all
    // when `chaId` is renamed in place). `frontUnshiftSelected` takes the
    // live `char` object, not a `chaId` string, and does its own
    // `untrack(() => char?.chaId)` read at the moment it is called. This
    // matters because 6b-char and its descendants do NOT re-run on an
    // in-place `chaId` rename (renaming an existing key's value never bumps
    // the key-set `version` that `Reflect.ownKeys(char)` depends on, so the
    // outer effect's closure is not torn down) -- if a child instead
    // captured `chaId` once when the outer effect last ran and reused that
    // captured value on every fronting call, a rename would leave every
    // field/chats-shape/per-chat/per-message fronting call pointing at the
    // OLD id, even though the field child that snapshots `chaId` itself
    // re-runs and (with this fix) fronts the NEW id. Since `char` is the
    // same object reference for the outer effect's whole lifetime, reading

    // `get(s)` subscribes the running effect to that key's VALUE source, not
    // just its existence. So `for...in char` doesn't just depend on char's
    // key set; it depends on the VALUE of every key char already has a
    // source for. On first mount 6b-front has already created `chats` and
    // `chatPage` sources, so a `chatPage` change alone reruns this whole
    // outer effect and rebuilds every field/chat/message child; after any
    // rerun, every field has a source, so every keystroke does the same.
    // `Reflect.ownKeys(char)` calls only the `ownKeys` trap (proxy.js:333-347:
    // `get(version); ... return own_keys`), never `getOwnPropertyDescriptor`,
    // so it depends on `version` (i.e. the key set) and nothing else -- no
    // per-key value subscription. Symbols are filtered out (character
    // objects carry only plain string data keys; Svelte's `STATE_SYMBOL` is
    // served by the proxy's `get` trap, not stored as an own key on the
    // target, so it never appears in `Reflect.ownKeys` here either way), and
    // there is no inherited-enumerable-key difference to worry about since
