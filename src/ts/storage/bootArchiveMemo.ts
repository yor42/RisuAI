/**
 * The device records of the boot archive pass, all in `localStorage`, which is
 * readable before the database is installed. None holds more about a character
 * than its `chaId`.
 *
 * The notice memo: the characters the pass skipped because their unit could
 * not be stored, whether the Node server refused the commit as too large, and
 * whether the user was told archiving is paused. The pass only reads it.
 * `bootstrap.ts` writes it, and only after it has posted the notice that carries
 * it, so a boot that never reaches the user leaves no memo and the next boot
 * behaves as if nothing had happened. Reads of the memo fail open: storage that
 * throws reads as an empty memo, and a write that throws is logged and ignored,
 * which costs a repeated notice or a retry on the next boot and nothing else.
 *
 * The strike count of the crash-loop breaker: the pass itself writes it, a
 * start record before it writes anything and a reset when it succeeds. It fails
 * closed. A count that cannot be read, a start record that cannot be written
 * and a stored value that is not a count all stop the pass, because a count
 * that reads as zero would let a crash loop run unbounded.
 *
 * Turning the setting off clears all of it.
 *
 * The stub-enrichment count bounds the boot pass's rewrite of upstream-made
 * stubs on a profile whose archiving is off, with the strike count's states and
 * its fail-closed rule, under its own key. `clearArchiveMemo` leaves it, because
 * the boot clears the archive memo on every boot that reads the setting off and
 * the count must outlive that. A completed enrichment attempt and a change of
 * the setting in Settings, in either direction, remove it; the boot-time clear
 * with archiving off does not. On a profile with archiving on the strike count
 * covers the same work and this key is not used.
 *
 * The restore-all count of the V2.1 plugin crash-loop breaker is a separate
 * record under its own key, outside `clearArchiveMemo` and outside the
 * fail-closed strike reader above. A start record is made before every archived
 * character is restored for an enabled V2.1 plugin, and a reset when the restore
 * loop ends. It fails open, the opposite of the strike count: a count that
 * cannot be read or a start record that cannot be written lets the restore run
 * uncounted with a warning, and a stored value that is not a non-negative
 * integer reads as zero. Failing closed would switch off the user's plugin
 * whenever storage throws or is full.
