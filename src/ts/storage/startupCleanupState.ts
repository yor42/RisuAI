/**
 * State of the startup clean-up (`cleanChunks` in bootstrap.ts), kept in a
 * module with no imports so any loader can wait on it without a cycle.
 *
 * Invariant: a database load waits on the recorded promise so that the
 * startup clean-up cannot delete a remote block that a snapshot references
 * between that snapshot's validation and its write. There is something to
 * wait for only while the clean-up is pending: `getStartupCleanup()` is
 * `null` before anything is recorded and once the clean-up has settled.
 *
 * The promise it returns always fulfils, whether the clean-up resolved or
 * rejected, so waiting on it never throws. Recording attaches handlers to the
 * caller's promise, which marks a rejection of that promise as handled: the
 * page's `unhandledrejection` handler never sees it, so the caller must
 * report a failure of its own clean-up itself.
