/**
 * A blocking alert returns the answer the user gave, whatever else is put in
 * the alert store after that answer and before the waiter looks again.
 *
 * Drives the REAL `alert.ts` against a real `writable` standing in for
 * `alertStore` from `stores.svelte`. The user's answer is the store write that
 * ends the alert, `{ type: 'none', msg: <answer> }`, which is what
 * `AlertComp.svelte` writes; a later alert is one of the module's own
 * functions, called in the same tick as the answer.
 *
 * Tests whose title starts with `guard:` pass with or without the fix: they
 * pin behaviour that must be preserved.
