 * it is still there, else the sole holder of its chaId, because the character may have been restored,
 * replaced or deleted while the prompt was open. Null when none is found (the tool then reports that
 * the character is gone). When that character is still an archived placeholder it is restored
 * from its unit first and the write goes to the restored character, found again by chaId; a failed
 * restore throws (reported as error text by `callTool`), leaves the placeholder unchanged and shows
