/**
 * Report 17 ("CHORE-01 + Phase 2 item 2") Stage 1 §3.3/§3.4, S5:
 *
 * Table-driven over every MUTATING risuaccess character tool, driven through
 * the REAL `RisuAccessClient.callTool` (`client.ts`), the REAL
 * `CharacterHandler` (`characters.ts`), the REAL `getCharacterForWrite`
 * (`utils.ts`), and the REAL `characterSaveMarks.ts` / `RisuSaveEncoder`
 * (encode -> decode round trip, since the table says "persisted"). Every
 * write here follows an AWAITED `promptAccess()` (`alertConfirm`) -- these
 * tests specifically resolve that confirm AFTER a "save" (tracker trim) has
 * already run, proving the mark (made in `callTool`'s `finally`, after the
 * handler settles) survives into the NEXT save rather than being silently
 * dropped by a save that raced the confirm dialog.
 *
 * The last test enumerates `CharacterHandler.getTools()` (the real registry)
 * and spies on the real, unmodified `getCharacterForWrite` to CLASSIFY, by
 * actual runtime behaviour (not by name-guessing), which registered tools
 * are mutating -- then asserts that set equals exactly the ones exercised
 * above, so a new mutating tool added later without updating this table
 * fails this test (plan rule 3).
