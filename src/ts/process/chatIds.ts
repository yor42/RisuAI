/**
 * Pure id fill and duplicate-warning helpers for chats and characters. Every
 * install route that can bring an id-less chat or character into the
 * database fills the missing id with a fresh one, and the install fills and
 * duplicate warnings never reassign or move an id already present.
 * `repairDatabaseIds` is the one exception: it is boot's own repair. It must
 * never run against the live database at runtime; it runs only at boot and
 * on a decoded backup, before that backup is installed. Work that holds a
 * reference across a backup load (a draft, a unit of work in flight) resolves
 * against the repaired backup once it is installed, which is a known
 * residual rather than something this guards against. Plugin-supplied
 * objects reach this module untyped, so every shape below is a loose
 * structural guard, not a domain type.
 *
 * This module's only runtime import is `uuid`: it never imports the app
 * store (`stores.svelte.ts`) or anything that pulls it in, so storage, boot
 * and backup code can use it without loading the rest of the app. The
 * live-data origin API (`writeAt`, `resolveOrigin`, `beginWork` and the
 * rest), which does need the live database, lives in `chatOrigin.ts`
 * instead.
