/**
 * Runs a character's input trigger, then its `editinput` script, and
 * appends the resulting user message to the chat the send started from.
 * `runTrigger` reads `char` and `startChat` directly, as given. The
 * `editinput` script reads the chat the message is appended to, through a
 * subject that prefers `startChat` when the chat's id has two holders, and
 * its Lua follows the same rule as a send's: it sees an empty chat and writes
 * nothing when the id has two holders. The append itself is resolved through
 * the origin, after every await this function makes, never through the live
 * `chatPage` -- a switch during either await must not move where the message
 * lands, and must never make two chats share one message array.
 *
 * The input trigger runs with `signal`, so a cancel stops its command lines,
 * and owns the composer's window: a `/multisend` in its command lines, or in a
 * trigger it runs, answers each segment.
 *
 * `workHandle` is acquired, and ended, by the caller: this function neither
 * calls `beginWork` nor calls `workHandle.end()`, so one work handle covers
 * every branch a caller's own send takes, not just the character branch.
 *
 * `onAppended` runs synchronously, in the same stretch as the push -- before
 * this function's own `await` returns control to its caller -- on both the
 * ok-status and the ambiguous path, so a caller can settle anything that
 * must stop looking cancelable the moment the append happens, rather than
 * after the caller's `await` resumes.
 *
 * Returns false, appending nothing, when `signal` is already aborted by the
 * time the append would run, or when that chat is gone by then. An
 * ambiguous origin still appends, to `startChat`, read at the moment of the
 * append.
