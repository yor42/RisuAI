/**
 * Brings the cold-storage character holding `chaId` back into memory through
 * `restoreColdCharacter`, which reads the unit, checks that it holds the same
 * `chaId` and installs it in the sole holder of that id that is still a
 * placeholder once the read is done. Resolves true when the character holding
 * that id is warm afterwards, false when it is not.
 *
 * This function tells the user why it failed, once and by the character's
 * name, with the wording that fits: a missing unit, an unreadable one, a unit
 * for another character, or a `chaId` held by several characters, before or
 * after the read. It stays silent when no character holds the id, before the
 * read or once it is done, and when the only holder is a placeholder that
 * points at another unit than the one read: then there is nothing to install.
 * The caller shows no alert of its own.
 *
 * `characters.ts` imports `doingChat` from `index.svelte.ts`, so a static
 * import of this module from `index.svelte.ts` would put a load-time cycle
 * through it. The send loads this module with a dynamic `import()` at the call
 * site, on the cold-member path only.
