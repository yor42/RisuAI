/**
 * How a blocking alert (a prompt) behaves when another alert covers it, when
 * code closes the store, and when a second prompt is asked for.
 *
 * Drives the REAL `alert.ts` (and `upstreamAgreement.ts`'s answer constant) over
 * a real `writable` standing in for `alertStore` from `stores.svelte`, as
 * `alert.blockingAnswer.test.ts` does. A user's answer is written to the raw
 * store the way `AlertComp.svelte` and `hotkey.ts` write it: `{ type: 'none',
 * msg: <answer> }`. Code that closes an alert goes through `alert.ts`:
 * `alertClear()` or the `alertStore` wrapper's `set`.
 *
 * Invariants pinned here:
 *  - a prompt's caller receives only the answer given while that prompt is the
 *    value on screen; never a cover's close, a code close, or another prompt's
 *    answer;
 *  - a cover shows at once, and the prompt it covered comes back when the cover
 *    closes;
 *  - prompts are shown in the order they were asked, and a prompt that a cover
 *    the user cannot close hides is put back on screen when another prompt is
 *    queued;
 *  - for 400 ms after a prompt appears on screen, however it got there (asked
 *    fresh, back from under a cover, or its turn arrived), an answer to it is
 *    discarded.
 *
 * Fake timers are on for every test, so the 400 ms guard is a clock the test
 * moves. Every outcome is read from a flag, never awaited, so a prompt that
 * wrongly stays pending fails an assertion instead of hanging the run.
 *
 * Tests whose title starts with `guard:` pass with or without the fix: they pin
 * behaviour that must be preserved.
